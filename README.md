## 🧮 Mathematical Foundations

### 🌲 Random Forest Algorithm

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

#### Mathematical Formulation:

For a dataset with n samples and m features, Random Forest builds B decision trees:

```
ŷ = (1/B) ∑(b=1 to B) T_b(x)
```

Where:
- `T_b(x)` is the prediction of the b-th tree
- `B` is the number of trees (default: 100)
- Each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample

#### Key Parameters:

1. **n_estimators**: Number of trees in the forest
   - Formula: `B ∈ [50, 100, 200, 300]`
   - Higher values reduce overfitting but increase computation

2. **max_depth**: Maximum depth of each tree
   - Controls tree complexity: `d ∈ [3, 5, 10, None]`
   - Prevents overfitting by limiting tree growth

3. **min_samples_split**: Minimum samples required to split a node
   - Range: `[2, 5, 10]`
   - Formula: `split_criterion = 2 * min_samples_split ≤ n_samples`

4. **min_samples_leaf**: Minimum samples required at a leaf node
   - Range: `[1, 2, 4]`
   - Ensures statistical significance of leaf predictions

#### Feature Importance Calculation:

```
Importance(f) = ∑(t=1 to T) ∑(s∈S_t) p(s) * Δi(s,t) * I(v(s) = f)
```

Where:
- `p(s)` is the proportion of samples reaching node s
- `Δi(s,t)` is the impurity decrease at node s in tree t
- `I(v(s) = f)` is 1 if feature f is used at node s, 0 otherwise

### 🚀 XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

XGBoost is a gradient boosting framework that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors from previous models.

#### Mathematical Formulation:

The objective function to minimize:

```
L(φ) = ∑(i=1 to n) l(y_i, ŷ_i) + ∑(k=1 to K) Ω(f_k)
```

Where:
- `l(y_i, ŷ_i)` is the loss function (log-likelihood for classification)
- `Ω(f_k)` is the regularization term for tree k
- `K` is the number of boosting rounds

#### Gradient Boosting Update:

```
ŷ_i^(t) = ŷ_i^(t-1) + η * f_t(x_i)
```

Where:
- `η` is the learning rate
- `f_t(x_i)` is the t-th tree prediction

#### Key Parameters:

1. **learning_rate (η)**: Step size shrinkage
   - Range: `[0.01, 0.1, 0.2]`
   - Lower values require more boosting rounds but reduce overfitting

2. **max_depth**: Maximum tree depth
   - Range: `[3, 6, 10]`
   - Controls model complexity

3. **n_estimators**: Number of boosting rounds
   - Range: `[50, 100, 200]`
   - More rounds can improve performance but risk overfitting

4. **subsample**: Fraction of samples used for training each tree
   - Range: `[0.8, 0.9, 1.0]`
   - Helps prevent overfitting through stochastic sampling

#### Regularization Terms:

```
Ω(f) = γT + (1/2)λ∑(j=1 to T) w_j²
```

Where:
- `γ` controls the number of leaves T
- `λ` controls the L2 regularization on leaf weights
- `w_j` are the leaf weights

### 📊 Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression models the probability of class membership using the logistic function.

#### Mathematical Formulation:

For multinomial classification (3 diabetes risk levels):

```
P(Y = k|X) = exp(β_k^T X) / ∑(j=1 to K) exp(β_j^T X)
```

Where:
- `β_k` is the parameter vector for class k
- `K = 3` (number of classes)
- `X` is the feature vector

#### Cost Function:

```
J(β) = -∑(i=1 to n) ∑(k=1 to K) y_ik * log(P(Y = k|x_i)) + α * R(β)
```

Where:
- `y_ik` is 1 if sample i belongs to class k, 0 otherwise
- `R(β)` is the regularization term
- `α` is the regularization strength

#### Key Parameters:

1. **C (Regularization Strength)**: Inverse of regularization parameter
   - Range: `[0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]`
   - Formula: `α = 1/C`
   - Higher C means less regularization

2. **penalty**: Type of regularization
   - L1 (Lasso): `R(β) = ||β||_1 = ∑|β_j|`
   - L2 (Ridge): `R(β) = ||β||_2² = ∑β_j²`
   - ElasticNet: `R(β) = α₁||β||_1 + α₂||β||_2²`

3. **solver**: Optimization algorithm
   - 'liblinear': Coordinate descent (good for small datasets)
   - 'lbfgs': L-BFGS (good for multiclass problems)
   - 'saga': Stochastic Average Gradient descent

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

### 🎯 Classification Metrics

#### 1. Accuracy
```
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
```
- Proportion of correct predictions
- Range: [0, 1], higher is better

#### 2. Precision (for each class k)
```
Precision_k = TP_k / (TP_k + FP_k)
```
- Proportion of positive predictions that are actually positive
- Important for minimizing false alarms

#### 3. Recall (Sensitivity)
```
Recall_k = TP_k / (TP_k + FN_k)
```
- Proportion of actual positives correctly identified
- Critical for detecting all diabetes cases

#### 4. F1-Score
```
F1_k = 2 * (Precision_k * Recall_k) / (Precision_k + Recall_k)
```
- Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Balances both metrics

#### 5. ROC-AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)
For multiclass problems, we use One-vs-Rest approach:
```
AUC_macro = (1/K) ∑(k=1 to K) AUC_k
```
- Measures the quality of predictions regardless of classification threshold
- Range: [0, 1], 0.5 is random, 1.0 is perfect

### 📈 Cross-Validation

#### K-Fold Cross-Validation (K=5)
Dataset is split into K folds, model is trained on K-1 folds and validated on the remaining fold:

```
CV_Score = (1/K) ∑(i=1 to K) Score_i
```

This provides:
- **Mean Score**: Average performance across folds
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of model stability
- **Confidence Interval**: Range of expected performance

## 🔬 Data Analytics Features

### 📊 Statistical Analysis

#### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- **Mean**: `μ = (1/n) ∑(i=1 to n) x_i`
- **Median**: Middle value when data is sorted
- **Standard Deviation**: `σ = √[(1/n) ∑(i=1 to n) (x_i - μ)²]`
- **Skewness**: `γ₁ = E[(X-μ)³]/σ³` (measures asymmetry)
- **Kurtosis**: `γ₂ = E[(X-μ)⁴]/σ⁴` (measures tail heaviness)

#### 2. Correlation Analysis
Pearson correlation coefficient:
```
r = ∑(x_i - x̄)(y_i - ȳ) / √[∑(x_i - x̄)² ∑(y_i - ȳ)²]
```
- Range: [-1, 1]
- |r| > 0.7: Strong correlation
- |r| < 0.3: Weak correlation

#### 3. Missing Value Analysis
